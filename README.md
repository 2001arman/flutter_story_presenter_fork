### Using `FlutterStoryViewController` 
`FlutterStoryViewController` is a controller class designed to manage the current story displayed on `FlutterStoryView`. It includes various methods such as `play()`, `pause()`, `jumpTo()`, `next()`, `previous()`, `mute(),` and `unMute()`, allowing you to control the existing StoryItem.

```dart
final storyController = FlutterStoryController();
FlutterStoryView(
    controller : storyController,
    items: [
        /// Story Item goes here
    ]
)
...
/// Somewhere in your code
storyController.pause();
storyController.play();
storyController.next();
storyController.previous();
storyController.jumpTo(2);
storyController.mute();
storyController.unMute();
```
